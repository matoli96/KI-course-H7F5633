# Task 1
## 2.a. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
This article highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different in situ gene expression profiling methods. These methods are used to analyze gene expression while preserving spatial information. From my perspective, as a medical doctor and a PhD student working with breast cancer, this article is medically relevant due to its potential applications in cancer research and precision medicine. In oncology, it is important to provide spatial insights into gene expression in tissues in order to improve biomarker discovery, treatment selection or even response to treatment. For example, errors in sensitivity and specificity (false positives) can lead to misleading conclusions that can have a negative impact on cancer diagnosis and therapy selection. Since this article compares different in situ gene expression profiling methods and introduces better ways to assess and improve their accuracy, this could help with the selection of the most appropriate technique not only for research applications but also for potential implementation in the clinic. 

## 2.b. Which genomics technology/technologies were used?
The study compares six different in situ gene expression profiling technologies using mouse brain datasets. Those genomic technologies include: Xenium (10x Genomics), MERSCOPE (Vizgen), and Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences), which are commercial technologies.  Additionally, the following academic methods were used:  MERFISH, STARmap PLUS, and EEL FISH. 

## 3.a List and explain at least three questions/hypotheses that extend the analysis presented in the paper.
This study used publicly available accessible mouse brain datasets, so one question could be on how these technologies optimized for the mouse tissue analysis would perform if human samples were used.  One way to extend the analysis presented in the article would be to test and compare these methods on human tissues, since human tissue is more complex. 
Another question could be on whether artificial intelligence and deep learning could improve molecular assignment and cell segmentation. For example, AI-driven image analysis could be used to distinguish true biological signals from technical noise and provide more accurate cell identification. 
Lastly, another extension of this article could be to explore whether the comparative analysis of multiplexed in situ gene expression profiling technologies could be used to further compare and examine spatial relationships between cells. For example, this could be particularly useful when studying the tumor microenvironment (TME) where the interaction between tumor cells, immune and stromal cells are important for cancer biology. 

## 3.b Devise a computational analysis strategy for (some of) the listed questions under 3a.
I am not sure that I can provide a full computational analysis, but I could describe my thoughts behind every question from 3a. 
In order to compare the different multiplex profiling in situ technologies in mouse and human tissues, we should first obtain a publicly available spatial transcriptomics dataset for human samples. Then, we can apply the study’s benchmarking metrics (MECR, sensitivity) to assess consistency. 
For this question, we could train a deep learning model to segment cells in spatial transcriptomics images. We could use manually annotated datasets as training data. Then, we can compare model performance against the current segmentation techniques used in the article.
I would like to propose a potential analysis for question 3 regarding the TME but I do not know how I could proceed with this type of analysis.

##2: Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants 

Description 
The CO2 data frame has 84 rows and 5 columns of data from an experiment on the cold tolerance of the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli.

Usage 
CO2 

Format 
An object of class c("nfnGroupedData", "nfGroupedData", "groupedData", "data.frame") containing the following columns:  

Plant 
an ordered factor with levels Qn1 < Qn2 < Qn3 < ... < Mc1 giving a unique identifier for each  plant. 

Type 
a factor with levels Quebec Mississippi giving the origin of the plant

Treatment 
a factor with levels nonchilled chilled  

conc 
a numeric vector of ambient carbon dioxide concentrations (mL/L). 

uptake 
a numeric vector of carbon dioxide uptake rates ( 𝜇 mol / 𝑚 2 μmol/m  2   sec).

##3: average and median CO2 uptake of the plants from Quebec and Mississippi
```{r}
###Average and median CO2 uptake for Quebec plants
mean(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Quebec"])  #this creates a vector and each row where Type is "Quebec" gets TRUE, and "Mississippi" gets FALSE
cat("Average CO2 uptake for Quebec plants:",mean(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Quebec"]),"\n")
median(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Quebec"])
cat("Median CO2 uptake for Quebec plants:",median(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Quebec"]),"\n")

###Average and median CO2 uptake for Mississippi plants
mean(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Mississippi"])
cat("Average CO2 uptake for Mississipi plants:",mean(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Mississippi"]),"\n")
median(CO2$uptake[CO2$Type == "Mississippi"])

#Task 6

  return(mean(vec, na.rm = TRUE) / median(vec, na.rm = TRUE)) # calculate mean and median while ignoring na values and return their ratio
}

##2:ignore the lowest and the highest value from a given vector and calculate the mean
trimmed_mean <- function(vec) {
  vec_trimmed <- vec[vec != min(vec, na.rm = TRUE)]
  vec_trimmed <- vec_trimmed[vec_trimmed != max(vec_trimmed, na.rm = TRUE)]
  return(mean(vec_trimmed, na.rm = TRUE))}
```

##3:Pipping-explanation of why, how, and when not to use pipes.
Pipes in R make the code easier to read by passing data from one function to another in a clear, left-to-right way, avoiding messy nested functions. They are great for organizing analysis steps but should be avoided in loops or when functions depend on the current environment.

##4: Apply-family of functions (apply, lapply, sapply etc.)-why they could be useful in my work.
The apply family in R (apply(), lapply(), sapply(), tapply()) simplifies repetitive calculations on data. apply() works on rows/columns, lapply() applies functions to lists, sapply() simplifies output, and tapply() groups data. They reduce loops, making analyses faster and cleaner.
The apply family has helped me efficiently apply functions to subsets of my data. I usually use it to process data frames, lists, or vectors—like extracting patient IDs from filenames.
